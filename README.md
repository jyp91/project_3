# Web Scraping Reddit.com Project 3

Reddit is a very popular American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. This project focuses on gathering data from Reddit.com by building a web-scraper using Python and BeautifulSoup library. With gathered data, I have used logistic regression, random-forest classification with grid-search model optimization to increase the accuracy of my model.
